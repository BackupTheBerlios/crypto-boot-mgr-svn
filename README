This is a set of scripts that are currently specific
to Fedora Core 3 Linux.

The scripts attempt to make it easier to set up a system
that has all its hard drive file systems encrypted, and
that must be booted using a USB memory stick that contains
special boot code and the file systems encryption keys.
